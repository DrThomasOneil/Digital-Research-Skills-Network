# DRSN

## Welcome

Welcome to the current site for the Analysis User Group! Whether you're just starting out with R or looking to strengthen your skills, this site is designed to foster a digital community centered around biomedical research programmatic analysis. 

Here, you'll find:

- Workshop schedules and announcements.
- Step-by-step instructions for workshop activities.
- Additional resources that might be of interest. 
 
Workshop material will aim to use publicly available data or mock created data. Therefore, you will not need to rely on uploaded data from the demonstrators/creators. Instead, a pre-workshop set-ups will include instructions for where to download and prep relevant data.
