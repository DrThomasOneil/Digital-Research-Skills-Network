### Computational Genomics with R

[Computational Genomics with R](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/) is an exceptionally comprehensive resource for biomedical bioinformatics. It covers a broad range of topics—statistics, machine learning, sequencing data processing, and more—while providing both code examples and clear explanations. Although it may not be the most accessible starting point for wet-lab researchers, it serves as an invaluable reference for deeper explorations of bioinformatic analyses.

### Stretchly

[Stretchly](https://hovancik.net/stretchly/) is an open-source app designed to encourage healthy work habits by prompting regular short (30-second) and long (20-minute) breaks. I’ve found it invaluable for maintaining focus and preventing burnout. It’s highly customizable, allowing you to tailor prompts to your needs.

### roadmap.sh

[roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) provides structured learning pathways for various tech-related skills, from Data Science to DevOps. The Data Science and AI roadmap outlines essential topics such as mathematics, statistics, and coding, along with curated free and paid learning resources. These roadmaps are community-driven and frequently updated, making them a great guide for self-paced learning.

### LinkedIn Learning

[LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) offers a vast library of online courses covering data analysis, programming (including R and Python), statistics, research skills, and professional development. There is a short [R for Data Science](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=2196204&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fr-for-data-science-analysis-and-visualization%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DgVEBrY1NSqeJQqBaQvzOLQ%253D%253D) course that is quite nice. 

You should have access to LinkedIn Learning through your University email. Otherwise, WIMR staff can apply for a license through WIMR.
