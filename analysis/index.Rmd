## Welcome

Welcome to the official site for the CVR Analysis User Group! Whether you're just starting out with R or looking to strengthen your skills, this site is designed to foster a digital community centred around biomedical research programmatic analysis. 

Here, you'll find:

- Workshop schedules and announcements.
- Step-by-step instructions for workshop activities.
- Additional resources that might be of interest. 

Workshop material will aim to use publicly available data. Therefore, you will not need to rely on uploaded data from the creators. Rather, the workshop set-ups will include scripts for downloading 

A wetlab researcher equipped with the power of programmatic analysis is a powerful scientist. We aim to make R more accessible and practical for such biomedical researchers.

## Using this site

This site is organised into several sections to help you quickly find what you need:

- **Getting Started in R:** A beginner-friendly guide to help you set up R and RStudio, along with key concepts and tips for coding.
- **Announcements:** Updates on upcoming workshops, deadlines, and important notices.
- **Workshops:** Detailed instructions, scripts, and examples for each workshop session.
- **Extra Resources:** Links to helpful tutorials, datasets, and cheat sheets. 

*Bookmark this site for quick access to scripts and updates as workshops progress.*

We are also always looking for feedback. Please reach out to [myself](thomas.oneil@sydney.edu.au) or [others](html/to/contacts/page).
