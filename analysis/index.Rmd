## Welcome

Welcome to the current site for the CVR Analysis User Group! Whether you're just starting out with R or looking to strengthen your skills, this site is designed to foster a digital community centered around biomedical research programmatic analysis. 

Here, you'll find:

- Workshop schedules and announcements.
- Step-by-step instructions for workshop activities.
- Additional resources that might be of interest. 
 
Workshop material will aim to use publicly available data or mock created data. Therefore, you will not need to rely on uploaded data from the demonstrators/creators. Instead, a pre-workshop set-ups will include instructions for where to download and prep relevant data. 

<hint-text style="text-size:1.2em">*Bookmark this site for quick access to scripts and updates as workshops progress.*</hint-text>

## Using this site

This site is organised into several sections to help you quickly find what you need:

- [**Getting Started in R:**](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/analysis-user-group/0_start.html) A beginner-friendly guide to help you set up R and RStudio, along with key concepts and tips for coding.
- [**Announcements:**](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/analysis-user-group/0_announcements.html) Updates on upcoming workshops, deadlines, and important notices.
- [**Workshops:**](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/analysis-user-group/0_workshops.html) Detailed instructions, scripts, and examples for each workshop session.
- [**Extra Resources:**](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/analysis-user-group/0_resources.html) Links to helpful tutorials, data sets, and cheat sheets. 
- [**Contacts:**](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/analysis-user-group/0_contacts.html) Acknowledge who contributed to these workshops! :) 

We are also always looking for feedback. Please reach out to [myself](thomas.oneil@sydney.edu.au) or [others](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/analysis-user-group/0_contacts.html).
