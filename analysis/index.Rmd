## Welcome!

Welcome to the Workshop site for the **Digital Research Skills Network**! Whether you're just starting out with R or looking to strengthen your skills, this site is designed to foster a digital community centered around biomedical research programmatic analysis. 
 
Workshop material will aim to use publicly available data or mock created data. Therefore, you will not need to rely on uploaded data from the demonstrators/creators. Instead, a pre-workshop set-ups will include instructions for where to download and prep relevant data.

#### <u>*Upcoming Events*</u>

## [**Bring Your Own Data!**](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/Digital-Research-Skills-Network/202506.html)

#### <i>**Tired of example data that never quite fits your needs? You're in luck!**</i>

This month, we’re hosting a **Bring Your Own Data** session - a hands-on, self-guided workshop designed to help you get started with analysing your own dataset.

Each session will begin with a brief presentation showcasing the core tools and workflows we typically use in R. After a short break, you’ll have the chance to apply those tools to your own data. Our team will be available throughout to guide, troubleshoot, and help you move forward with your analysis - no matter the dataset or research question.
