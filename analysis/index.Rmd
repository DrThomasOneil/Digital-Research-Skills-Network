## Welcome!

Welcome to the Workshop site for the **Digital Research Skills Network**! Whether you're just starting out with R or looking to strengthen your skills, this site is designed to foster a digital community centered around biomedical research programmatic analysis. 
 
Workshop material will aim to use publicly available data or mock created data. Therefore, you will not need to rely on uploaded data from the demonstrators/creators. Instead, a pre-workshop set-ups will include instructions for where to download and prep relevant data.

## [**Getting started with Spatial Transcriptomics at WIMR**](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/Digital-Research-Skills-Network/202505.html)

DRSN will be collaborating with **PrecisionGo** and **10X Genomics** to explore the options at WIMR for Spatial Transcriptomics, and the key considerations when analyzing Visum and Xenium data. Join us for the informative **Seminar** session for how you can get started and what to expect from Spatial Transcriptomics. Stick around for the **In-focus discussion** where we'll be joined by *Geoffrey McDermott* (**10X Genomics**) to discuss Xenium and Visium data preparations (e.g. panel design, cell segmentation) and data analysis. Lastly, join *Thomas O'Neil* at the **Analysis Workshop** to learn how you can download public Visium data, processs it and start creating visualisations yourself, immediately elevating your thesis, manuscript or grant application.
