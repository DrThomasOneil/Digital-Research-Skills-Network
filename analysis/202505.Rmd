## **Spatial Transcriptomics**: What's available and what's the way

DRSN will be collaborating with PrecisionGo and 10X Genomics to explore the options in WIMR to perform spatial transcriptomics, and the key considerations when analyzing the data from common modalities such as Visum and Xenium. It'll be a taste of how you can use spatial transcriptomic data to answer your own research questions, and how to tackle the analytical challenges.

#### **Monday 5th May** (WIMR Seminar Room & Zoom)

##### [Seminar (11am)](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/analysis-user-group/202505_Seminar.html)

Discuss the power of spatial transcriptomic technoogy available at WIMR. Then we'll hear from the researcher who adopts the method to study Chron's disease.

**Speakers**: Joey Lai, Li Ma, Kirstie Bertram    
(lunch from 12pm)

##### [In-focus Workshop (1 – 3pm)](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/analysis-user-group/202505_InFocus.html)

With the help of 10X Genomics we will discuss the key analytical considerations of Visum and Xenium data analysis.

**Speakers**: 10X Genomics

#### **Monday 19th May** (WIMR Seminar Room & Zoom)

##### [Programming workshop (1 – 3pm)](https://drthomasoneil.github.io/analysis-user-group/202505_Workshop.html)

We will demonstrate the process of finding public Visium data, exploring the structure of the data, and generating quick and easy figures that can instantly elevate your paper and grant.


**Demonstrators**: Thomas O'Neil
