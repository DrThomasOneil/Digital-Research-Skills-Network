<span style="color:black;">Flow cytometry analysis is often performed using intuitive, UI-based software like FlowJo, but as datasets grow in complexity, programming tools like R offer powerful alternatives. This seminar will contrast standard software workflows with programming-based approaches, highlighting where GUI-based tools excel and where scripting can unlock deeper insights. Weâ€™ll explore the strengths and limitations of both, covering practical examples, key decision points, and a case study where coding provided the flexibility needed to push analysis beyond software constraints.
