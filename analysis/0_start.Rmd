## **Session 0: What Is Programming? Shifting Mindsets**

<div class="hint-goals">
**Goal:**  
Introduce programming concepts and the mindset behind programmatic workflows.  
- What is programming and why use R?  
- Moving from manual Excel edits to reproducible code.  
- Working with directories and file paths.  
- Scripts vs manual edits – automating tasks.  
</div>

<div class="hint-practice">
**Practice:**  
- Navigating directories (`getwd()`, `setwd()`).  
- Creating folders and listing files.  
</div>

## **Session 1: Getting Started with R and RStudio**
**Goal:** Set up R and RStudio, and get familiar with the interface.

- Installing R and RStudio.
- Exploring the interface – Console, Environment, Scripts.
- Setting up a project.
- Installing and loading packages.

**Practice:**
- Create and save an R script.
- Install and load a package (e.g., `tidyverse`).

---

## **Session 2: Data Types and Structures**
**Goal:** Learn about data types and structures in R.

- Basic data types: numeric, character, logical.
- Data structures: vectors, matrices, data frames, lists.
- Importing data (Excel and CSV files).
- Viewing and summarizing data.

**Practice:**
- Load flow cytometry data and explore structure.
- Create and index vectors and data frames.

---

## **Session 3: Data Manipulation with `dplyr`**
**Goal:** Introduce `dplyr` for filtering, mutating, and summarizing data.

- Filtering rows (`filter()`), selecting columns (`select()`).
- Adding new columns (`mutate()`).
- Grouping and summarizing (`group_by()` + `summarize()`).

**Practice:**
- Calculate proportions for CD4/CD8 populations.
- Add calculated columns for analysis.

---

## **Session 4: Basic Programming and Control Structures**
**Goal:** Understand programming logic for automating tasks.

- Variables and assignments.
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`).
- Loops (`for`, `while`).
- Writing functions.

**Practice:**
- Write functions to calculate percentages dynamically.
- Automate filtering tasks.

---

## **Session 5: Visualization with `ggplot2` – Part 1**
**Goal:** Create and customize visualizations.

- Basics of `ggplot2` – scatter, bar, and boxplots.
- Customizing labels, themes, and colors.

**Practice:**
- Visualize CD4 vs CD8 proportions.
- Add colors and themes.

---

## **Session 6: Advanced Visualization with `ggplot2` – Part 2**
**Goal:** Learn advanced visualization techniques.

- Faceting and small multiples.
- Combining plots (grid layouts).
- Saving high-resolution plots.

**Practice:**
- Create faceted boxplots for subsets.
- Export plots for reports.

---

## **Session 7: Statistical Analysis**
**Goal:** Understand descriptive and inferential statistics.

- Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode.
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA).
- Correlation and regression.

**Practice:**
- Test differences in CD4 proportions.
- Perform correlation analysis.

---

## **Session 8: Reproducible Reports with RMarkdown**
**Goal:** Build dynamic and shareable reports.

- Introduction to RMarkdown.
- Combining text, code, and visuals.
- Exporting to PDF and HTML.

**Practice:**
- Create a report summarizing flow cytometry data.
- Embed visualizations and tables.

---

## **Session 9: Mini Project – Putting It All Together**
**Goal:** Apply skills to a complete workflow.

**Practice:**
- Load and clean data.
- Summarize and visualize trends.
- Run tests and compile everything into a report.

---

## **Session 10: Troubleshooting and Workflow Design**
**Goal:** Teach debugging strategies and workflow optimization.

- Debugging errors and warnings.
- Writing modular scripts (functions).
- Organizing larger projects.
- Brief intro to Git/GitHub for version control.

**Practice:**
- Debug a script with errors.
- Restructure code for reusability.
