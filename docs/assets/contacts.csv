Committee Chair,assets/headshot/TO.jpg,Thomas O'Neil,PostDoc,"thomas.oneil@sydney.edu.au<br>I have been with the Mucosal Immunity lab at WIMR since my honours year in 2018. I completed my [PhD](https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/31626) in 2023 and am now a post-doc in the same lab. Initially, my studies involved characterising anogenital T cells by flow cytometry, but having learned analytic programming during COVID, I now study all aspects of human tissue immunology via high-parameter proteomic and transcriptomic bioinformatic approaches. Specifically, I've been involved in identifying rare immune cell subsets and defining their roles in initial HIV infection. Recently, I've been developing and applying bioinformatic methods to investigate immune cells in inflamed and uninflamed human tissues using spatial technologies (IMC, Xenium & Visium)."
Secretary,assets/headshot/TBA.jpg,Harry Robertson,PhD Candidate,"Harry Robertson is a research student and aspiring bioinformatician at WIMR who was recently awarded a Fulbright Future Scholarship (Postgraduate) hosted by Harvard University. His Fulbright research focuses on identifying biomarkers for organ transplant health using advanced imaging techniques. Unlike traditional biomarkers, which often require expensive sequencing and are inaccessible to many, Harry’s innovative approach leverages machine learning to analyse imaging data, aiming to develop a universally available, non-invasive diagnostic tool for transplant recipients.<br><br>Harry envisions a future where healthcare decisions are informed by comprehensive patient data: ‘my goal is to make this vision a reality by developing accessible biomarkers for organ transplant health.’"
